## About Me

Computer Science graduate from Virginia Tech with a minor in Mathematics.  
Currently serving in the U.S. Army while expanding into cybersecurity, systems engineering, and infrastructure.

I enjoy working close to the system — operating systems, networking, performance, and security fundamentals.

---

## Current Focus

- Linux system administration
- Networking fundamentals (TCP/IP, DNS, HTTP)
- Security+ (SY0-701)
- Building a structured cybersecurity knowledge base
- Developing practical, lab-driven skills

---

## Technical Background

**Languages:**  
Java • C • Python • JavaScript • SQL • MATLAB • Swift

**Systems & Tools:**  
Linux • Git • Bash • React • Vite • Tailwind • Three.js

**Core Strengths:**  
Algorithms • Data Structures • Systems Programming • Modular Architecture • Performance Optimization

---

## Selected Projects

### 3D Samurai Duel Game
Turn-based 3D combat system built with Three.js and Tween.js.  
Modular ES6 architecture separating animation systems, game logic, and UI components.

### Postal Scanner (C)
Geographical lookup tool supporting distance calculations between multiple locations.  
Implemented structured input handling and coordinate-based computation.

### External Sorting Engine (Java)
File-based sorting system using modified Quicksort and Insertion Sort with buffer pool optimization.  
Tracked cache hits, disk reads/writes, and execution time.

---

## Current Development Direction

Transitioning from traditional software engineering into:

- Systems security
- Network defense
- Infrastructure engineering
- Low-level systems tooling

Building everything publicly. Documenting the process.
